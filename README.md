# AB_Testing_Project


Purposes of the Project - Introducing Hypothesis Testing logic and Statistics
----------------------


Hypothesis testing or AB Testing is a basic yet essential knowledge in data science field. In order to prove that I have such decent knowledge and that am capable of conducting those logics, certain data set was selected and developed hypothesis. After going through the report, readers might know what hypothesis testing is and how to conduct such analysis. 

Report is composed of three main parts. First of all, data clenaing and organizing would be explained so that the data is cleaned and suitable for further research. Second part, since data frame is cleaned, hypothesis testing is going to be proceeded by establishing proper hypothesis, introducing steps to follow, and interpreting results. In the final part, overall summary is going to be suggested so that people would know what implications they can find in the statistical results.



Data Explanation
---------------------

Let's say there is one company that are planning to launch new web page in order to lead consumer to actually purchase a product rather than just watch items and log out. Dataset contains these consideration in several variables(columns).

(1) user_id: Id of users

(2) timestamp: stansfor the duration of time people spent in the website

(3) group: treatment group VS control group

(4) landing_page: old page VS new page

(5) converted: 0 VS 1(0 stands for that they did not move on to actual purchase, whereas 1 means customers made actual purchase)

(6) country: Country people live in. In this chase, there are US, UK and CA citizens. 

Based on these variables, I am going to answer a simple question that requires hypothesis testing. 
Q: Does new home page actually attracted people to buy items?
